# Expense Tracker  

This is my small project made in Python.  
It is a simple expense tracker where I used **Tkinter** for making the window (frontend) and **SQLite** for storing data (database).  

## What it can do  
- Add new expense with amount, category, date and note  
- Show all expenses in a table  
- Delete any expense  
- Show total spent  
- Show summary by category  

## Tools I used  
- Python  
- Tkinter  
- SQLite  

## How to run  
1. Install Python 3 in your system  
2. Download this repository  
3. Run the file
4. A small window will open and you can start adding expenses
